Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Physics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Here at Duke, I am working with [Dr. Eve Vavagiakis](https://evevavagiakis.com/) to establish a new experimental cosmology instrumentation laboratory. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in Chemistry at Queens University of Charlotte in Charlotte, North Carolina. I then joined the [Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge Program](https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org), where I received a Master's degree in Physics from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, under the direction of Dr. Arnold Burger in the [Materials Science Applications Group](https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/msag).

In 2023, I received my Ph.D. in [Exploration Systems Design](https://sese.asu.edu/degree/graduate/exploration-systems-design-instrumentation-phd) from Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration. At ASU, I worked under the direction of Dr. Philip Mauskopf to develop cryogenic readout harnesses for the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org).
